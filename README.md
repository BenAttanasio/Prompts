# prompts

A collection of prompts I've found useful. Some will save you hours. Some are just fun. 3M+ Reddit views on some of these.

## How to use

Copy and paste into AI chatbots like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini (use Thinking mode for longer prompts). Make it yours.

As of Nov 2025, Claude Skills are out. I'd recommend building a library of those.
